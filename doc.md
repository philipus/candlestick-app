This App demonstrates candlestick pattern on the big 5 stock price daily chart. So, You can choose stock symbol

* Amazon
* Apple
* Facebook
* Micrsoft
* Amazon

and the candlestick pattern. For the pattern you can choose between two paterns

* baerish engulf
* bullish engulf

The engulf pattern compares two consecutive candels. When a green candle exceeds a former red candle it is a bullish engulf pattern. when a red candle exceeds a former green candle it is a baerish pattern. In theory after a bullish engulf (baerish engulf) should go the stock price up (down) but you can see for Apple that we have lots of baerish engulf signals but the price just go up afterwards.

The annotation helps you to find the day where the pattern appears. Use the zoom functionality from plotly to have a closer look at it.
